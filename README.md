# How to run the code in VS-Code
1. Download the main zip file and then unzip it
2. Open your folder in Files and locate the "-fastq.gz" files you need
3. Unzip them in your Files by clicking on them
4. This would turn your -fastq.gz file into a -fastq file 
5. Open the main folder in VS-Code
6. Make sure the folder contains the GLDS-621_rna-seq_Bulk_072022_1G_R1_raw.fastq and GLDS-621_rna-seq_Bulk_072022_uG_R1_raw.fastq files as well. 
7. Run the needleman.py file

# How to run the code in your terminal
1. Download the zip file and then unzip it
2. Open your folder in Files and locate the "-fastq.gz" files you need
3. Unzip them in your Files by clicking on them
4. This would turn your -fastq.gz file into a -fastq file
5. "cd /.." your way to the unzipped folder
6. "ls" to make sure the folder contains the GLDS-621_rna-seq_Bulk_072022_1G_R1_raw.fastq and GLDS-621_rna-seq_Bulk_072022_uG_R1_raw.fastq files as well. 
7. Run "python3 needleman.py" in the terminal
