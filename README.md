# CS123A-Final-Project
Sequence Alignment Using Needleman Wunsch Algorithm to Study Microgravity Effects on PBMCs

# How to run the code in VS-Code
1. Download the main zip file and then unzip it
2. Go to [this Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12fqF19upNS8l2udfyDL6Vgzf2WNuP_yj?usp=sharing) and download both GLDS-621_rna-seq_Bulk_072022_1G_R1_raw.fastq.gz and GLDS-621_rna-seq_Bulk_072022_uG_R1_raw.fastq.gz files into the main CS123A-Final-Project folder (the folder you obtain when you download the zip from this repo).
3. Open that folder in Files and locate the "-fastq.gz" files you need
4. Unzip them in your Files by clicking on them
5. This would turn your -fastq.gz file into a -fastq file 
6. Open the main (the one obtained from this repo) folder in VS-Code
7. Make sure the folder contains the GLDS-621_rna-seq_Bulk_072022_1G_R1_raw.fastq and GLDS-621_rna-seq_Bulk_072022_uG_R1_raw.fastq files (not the same as .gz) as well. 
8. Run the needleman.py file

# How to run the code in your terminal
1. Download the zip file and then unzip it
2. Go to [this Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12fqF19upNS8l2udfyDL6Vgzf2WNuP_yj?usp=sharing) and download both GLDS-621_rna-seq_Bulk_072022_1G_R1_raw.fastq.gz and GLDS-621_rna-seq_Bulk_072022_uG_R1_raw.fastq.gz files into the main CS123A-Final-Project folder (the folder you obtain when you download the zip from this repo).
3. Open that folder in Files and locate the "-fastq.gz" files you need
4. Unzip them in your Files by clicking on them
5. This would turn your -fastq.gz file into a -fastq file
6. Open Terminal and then "cd /.." your way to the unzipped folder
7. "ls" to make sure the folder contains the GLDS-621_rna-seq_Bulk_072022_1G_R1_raw.fastq and GLDS-621_rna-seq_Bulk_072022_uG_R1_raw.fastq files (not the same as .gz) as well. 
8. Run "python3 needleman.py" in the terminal
